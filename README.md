# Recipe Finder
Welcome to our recipe finding application! As avid home chefs we know how crazy it can be when using a new recipe. From finding that fun new recipe to putting together a grocery list of needed ingredients to make it.
Our Recipe Finder is here to alleviate that stress and be your One-Stop Shop for all your recipe needs. With our application you will be able to search recipes by searching a food item, and then you can hone your search by adding additional filters such as main course, gluten free, vegetarian, and more! After you search, you can scroll through the available recipes. You always have the chance to make another search if the results are not as specific as you want. Clicking on the star in the top right of each recipe card allows you to save that recipe to your own cookbook )accessible through the "My Cookbook" button in the top left of every page. Once you are inside of your cookbook, you can click on any recipe to open up an interactive list of the recipe's ingredients. You will be able to see the cook time of the recipe, serving size, an image of the dish, and the list of its ingredients. Checking the box by an ingredient will save that ingredient to the local storage to display it later in your grocery list. Clicking the "Grocery List" button in the top left of the page will bring you to your copy and pastable grocery list! All the ingredients you selected will show up for you to copy and paste into a text or email to your roommate before they leave work. 

For this application we used HTML to build out the structure of our pages as well as the elements that persist from page to page. CSS was used in very specific cases to effect sizing, create custom breakpoints, and create custom style classes. Javascript was used to create and style dynamicly updated elements for our pages. Tailwind was used to style the entire project, using its framework to do so. By being sinmplistic in our HTML structure it was extremely easy for three people to code side by side, by using the dynamically created elements both styling and functionality of the pages became more fluid, appealing, and useable. We decided to use CSS as a scalpel in very specific situations to make sure the application looked they way we desired and worked on multiple screen sizes as intended.
